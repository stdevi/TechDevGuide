#WithoutString problem
You'll get a good programming workout with this mid-range Java problem-solving, which involves removing one string from another. 
Hint: this one isn't case sensitive.

Given two strings, base and remove, return a version of the base string where all instances of the remove string have been removed (not case sensitive). 
You may assume that the remove string is length 1 or more. Remove only non-overlapping instances, so with "xxx" removing "xx" leaves "x".
