# blackjack problem
Coding goes to the casino for some practice in testing and debugging via this blackjack-inspired warm-up exercise created by Google.

Given 2 int values greater than 0, return whichever value is nearest to 21 without going over. Return 0 if they both go over.


`blackjack(19, 21) → 21`  
`blackjack(21, 19) → 21`  
`blackjack(19, 22) → 19`
