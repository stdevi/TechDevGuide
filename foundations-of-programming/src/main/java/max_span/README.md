#maxSpan problem
In this not-too-hard, not-too-easy option, you'll tackle arrays and the appearance of values.
Take your time with this one â€” efficiency isn't a priority.

Consider the leftmost and righmost appearances of some value in an array. We'll say that the "span" is the number of elements between the two inclusive. 
A single value has a span of 1. Returns the largest span found in the given array. (Efficiency is not a priority.)
