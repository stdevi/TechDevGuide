# makeBricks problem
See if you have enough bricks to reach a certain length in this Java-based logic problem. Warning: this is a tough one.


We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). 
Return true if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. This is a little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops. See also:

`makeBricks(3, 1, 8) → true`  
`makeBricks(3, 1, 9) → false`  
`makeBricks(3, 2, 10) → true`
