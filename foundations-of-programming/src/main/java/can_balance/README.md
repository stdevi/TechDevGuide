Put on your thinking cap for this ambitious exercise, where you'll need to determine if there's a place to split a non-empty   
array so that the sums of the numbers on both sides equal each other.


Given a non-empty array, return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is   
equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.
