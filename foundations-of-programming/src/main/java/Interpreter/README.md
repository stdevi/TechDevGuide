#Simple interpreter problem-solving, in Java
Your mission: Write a simple interpreter in Java that understands the "+", "-", and "*" operations, then apply them. 
This is an exacting, Google-created exercise, so take your time.

Write a simple interpreter which understands "+", "-", and "*" operations. Apply the operations in order using command/arg 
pairs starting with the initial value of `value`. If you encounter an unknown command, return -1.


`interpret(1, ["+"], [1]) → 2`
`interpret(4, ["-"], [2]) → 2`
`interpret(1, ["+", "*"], [1, 3]) → 6`
